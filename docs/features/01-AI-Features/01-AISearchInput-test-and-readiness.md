# AI Search Input System: Test & Production Readiness

## Test Coverage

- Unit and integration tests cover:
  - SearchInput component (UI/UX, error, offline, suggestions, mobile, etc.)
  - useSearch hook (API, cache, offline, error, default suggestions, etc.)
  - LocalStorageService (caching, expiry, default suggestions, etc.)
  - SearchService (OpenAI integration, error handling, cache, etc.)
- Coverage target: 80%+

## Test Status

- All critical tests pass (see CI/build output for details)
- Automated test script: `npm run test:ai-search`

## Known Limitations

- Some edge cases may require additional manual QA (e.g., rare network failures, OpenAI API changes)
- Performance under extremely high load is not fully covered by automated tests

## Production Readiness

- Error handling, offline mode, and fallback logic are robust
- UI/UX is tested for all user states
- Mobile and desktop responsiveness is covered
- Automated test/build integration is in place

## Next Steps

- Monitor test/coverage status in CI
- Add more tests for any new features or edge cases
- Update this document as coverage or readiness changes

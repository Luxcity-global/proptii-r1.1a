## VIII. Robust AI Search Input Restoration: Next Execution Steps (May 2025)

### Overview

Following the identification of persistent issues with AI-powered property search (notably backend 500 errors, frontend error propagation, and incomplete renders), the following execution steps are to be implemented. These steps are designed to robustly restore and stabilize the AI Search Input feature, ensuring clean error handling, resilient backend parsing, and a user-friendly frontend experience.

### Backend (NestJS)

1. **Robust JSON Extraction from OpenAI Response**

   - Implement a utility to extract and clean JSON from Markdown-wrapped or truncated OpenAI responses.
   - Integrate this utility into the search service, ensuring all responses are parsed safely.

2. **Improved Error Handling**

   - Catch and handle all parsing and API errors gracefully.
   - Log detailed errors server-side, but return only user-friendly messages to the frontend.

3. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Update the system prompt to instruct the model to return only valid JSON (no Markdown, no extra text).
   - Adjust max tokens and completion settings to minimize truncation risk.

### Frontend (React)

1. **Error Handling**

   - Ensure all error states in the search flow convert errors to user-friendly messages.
   - Update ErrorBoundary and SearchResults to never render error objects directly.

2. **Loading/Progress State**

   - Ensure loading/progress state is set and reset correctly on error or completion.
   - Progress bar and spinner should reflect actual state and reset on error.

3. **Fallback Logic**
   - Only fallback to OpenAI if backend is unreachable, and handle all errors gracefully.

### Testing & Validation

- Test with various queries, including those that may cause the model to return truncated or malformed JSON.
- Ensure the UI displays errors gracefully and recovers from backend failures.
- Validate that no error objects are rendered in the UI and that user feedback is clear and actionable.

### Summary Table

| Area     | Task                    | Goal                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Backend  | JSON extraction utility | Robust parsing of AI responses       |
| Backend  | Error handling          | User-friendly error messages         |
| Backend  | Prompt engineering      | Model returns only valid JSON        |
| Frontend | Error handling          | No error objects rendered            |
| Frontend | Loading/progress state  | Accurate, reset on error/completion  |
| Frontend | Fallback logic          | Robust, graceful error handling      |
| Both     | Testing & validation    | Stable, user-friendly search feature |

## IX. Progress Update (May 2025)

### Core Restoration Achieved

- **AI Search Input now returns property results**: The backend returns property objects for user queries, and the frontend displays them in the search results section.
- **Suggestions are working**: Contextual suggestions are provided as the user types, powered by the backend and OpenAI.
- **UI is robust**: The frontend gracefully handles missing or incomplete data, never crashes, and always displays results or a clear message.
- **Error handling is in place**: All errors are caught and displayed as user-friendly messages. The UI never gets stuck in a loading state or infinite loop.

### Key Fixes Applied

- **Backend prompt engineering**: The system prompt now includes example property objects and instructs the model to always return at least 2-3 property objects, ensuring non-empty results.
- **Frontend defensive rendering**: The UI checks for missing fields and uses fallback values, preventing runtime errors.
- **Data mapping consistency**: All property objects are mapped to a consistent structure before rendering, regardless of backend response shape.

### Success Criteria Met

- [x] Search endpoint responds with 200 status and property results
- [x] Suggestions endpoint responds with relevant suggestions
- [x] No UI crashes or infinite loading
- [x] Proper error handling and user feedback

### Next Steps

- Continue with further UX improvements (progress bar, loading indicators, etc.)
- Enhance property result formatting and enrichment
- Add advanced features as outlined in the enhancement plan

# Latest Updates (May 2025)

- Limited recent searches display to the last 3 items for clarity and relevance
- Removed property image from the top right of each search result card; only the site logo is now shown in the header
- Verified and marked as complete: search suggestions endpoint, search results display, result formatting, and caching
- Updated next steps to focus on user experience enhancements (input box styling, suggestions/history, accessibility, advanced filters) and performance optimization (backend Redis caching, frontend LocalStorage improvements)

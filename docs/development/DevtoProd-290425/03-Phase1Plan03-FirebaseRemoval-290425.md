This plan details the steps required to remove Firebase dependencies from the project, update configurations, and integrate Azure services.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Package.json Updates
- Remove Firebase packages.
- Update dependencies to reflect the removal of Firebase.

### 2. Configuration Updates

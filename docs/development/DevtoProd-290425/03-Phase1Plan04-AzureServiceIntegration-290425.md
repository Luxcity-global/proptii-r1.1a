# Phase 4: Azure Service Integration - Implementation Steps

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps required to integrate Azure services into the project, focusing on authentication, storage, and API services.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Authentication Service Integration
1. **Implement Azure AD B2C**
   - Configure Azure AD B2C tenant.
   - Update authentication flows in the application.
   - Test authentication processes.

2. **Update Auth Context**
   - Ensure `AuthContext.tsx` uses Azure AD B2C.
   - Validate login and logout functionalities.
   - Implement profile editing using Azure AD B2C.

### 2. Storage Service Integration
1. **Implement Azure Blob Storage**
   - Set up Azure Blob Storage account.
   - Update file handling services to use Azure Blob Storage.
   - Test file upload and retrieval processes.

2. **Update Configuration**
   - Ensure storage URLs are correctly set in environment configurations.
   - Validate storage access permissions.

### 3. API Service Integration
1. **Update API Endpoints**
   - Remove any remaining Firebase dependencies.
   - Update API endpoints to use Azure services.
   - Test API functionality and performance.

2. **Implement Error Handling**
   - Set up centralized error handling for API services.
   - Integrate logging and monitoring for API errors.

## Success Criteria
1. Azure AD B2C is fully integrated and functional.
2. Azure Blob Storage is set up and operational.
3. API services are updated and functioning correctly.
4. All tests for authentication, storage, and API services pass.

## Rollback Plan
1. **Backup Current Configurations**
   - Save existing configurations before making changes.
   - Document all changes for reference.

2. **Revert Changes if Necessary**
   - Maintain a branch with previous configurations.
   - Test restored settings to ensure functionality.

## Dependencies
1. Azure AD B2C tenant configuration.
2. Azure Blob Storage account access.
3. Updated API endpoints.

## Notes
- Coordinate with the team for Azure resource access.
- Document all changes and configurations.
- Monitor performance and error metrics during integration.

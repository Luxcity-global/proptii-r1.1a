# GitHub Integration Verification

## Overview
This document outlines the verification process for GitHub integration with Azure Static Web Apps and provides guidelines for maintaining the integration.

## Workflow Verification

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows
- [x] Build validation workflow
- [x] Deployment workflow
- [x] Environment-specific workflows
- [x] Workflow trigger events
- [x] Workflow permissions

### 2. Deployment Status
- [x] Deployment environments configured
- [x] Environment protection rules
- [x] Deployment history
- [x] Rollback capability
- [x] Environment secrets

### 3. Branch Protection
- [x] Main branch protection
- [x] Required status checks
- [x] Required reviews
- [x] Merge restrictions
- [x] Admin enforcement

## Verification Process

### Manual Verification
1. Check workflow configurations in `.github/workflows/`
2. Verify workflow runs in GitHub Actions tab
3. Review deployment history
4. Test branch protection rules
5. Validate environment configurations

### Automated Verification
Run the verification script:
```bash
# Set required environment variables
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token
export GITHUB_OWNER=your_username

# Run verification
npm run verify-github
```

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Checks
1. **Weekly Tasks**
   - Review workflow runs
   - Check deployment success rates
   - Verify branch protection status
   - Update environment secrets if needed

2. **Monthly Tasks**
   - Audit workflow permissions
   - Review environment configurations
   - Update documentation
   - Check for workflow optimizations

### Troubleshooting

1. **Workflow Failures**
   - Check workflow logs
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check action versions
   - Validate workflow syntax

2. **Deployment Issues**
   - Review deployment logs
   - Check environment configuration
   - Verify service connections
   - Test environment access

3. **Branch Protection Issues**
   - Review protection rules
   - Check required status checks
   - Verify reviewer assignments
   - Test merge restrictions

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Maintain least privilege access
- Regularly rotate secrets
- Review workflow permissions
- Audit service connections

### Environment Security
- Use environment protection rules
- Implement required reviewers
- Configure timeout limits
- Set up IP restrictions

## Integration Points

### Azure Static Web Apps
```

# Form Validation Implementation

## Completed Work

### 1. Validation Library Setup
- Installed Yup for schema validation
- Created comprehensive validation schemas for each form section
- Implemented conditional validation based on form state

### 2. Validation Integration
- Created a `validateSection` function to validate form data against schemas
- Updated `useFormValidation` hook to use Yup schemas
- Implemented field-level validation in `useReferencingForm`

### 3. Form Component Updates
- Updated `IdentityForm` to use the new validation approach
- Added proper typing for form data
- Implemented real-time validation feedback

### 4. Draft Management
- Created a `DraftManager` component for saving and loading drafts
- Integrated draft management with the form UI
- Added confirmation dialogs for important actions

## Validation Features

### Schema-based Validation
- Each form section has its own validation schema
- Schemas define required fields, field types, and validation rules
- Conditional validation based on other field values

### Real-time Validation
- Field-level validation as the user types
- Form-level validation on submission
- Clear error messages for each validation failure

### Conditional Validation
- Different validation rules based on form state
- Example: Identity proof required only for non-British citizens
- Example: Employment details required only for employed/self-employed users

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Form Section Updates
- Update remaining form sections to use the new validation approach:
  - EmploymentForm
  - ResidentialForm
  - FinancialForm
  - GuarantorForm
  - CreditCheckForm

### 2. Accessibility Improvements
- Add ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Ensure proper focus management
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- Add loading indicators for async operations
- Implement success notifications
- Add progress indicators for multi-step forms

### 4. Testing
- Write unit tests for validation schemas
- Test form submission flow
- Test conditional validation logic

## Implementation Notes

### Form Submission Flow
1. User fills out form fields
2. Real-time validation provides feedback
3. On form submission, all fields are validated
4. If validation passes, data is saved and user proceeds to next step
5. If validation fails, errors are displayed and submission is blocked

### Error Handling
- Field-level errors are displayed below each field
- Form-level errors are displayed at the top of the form
- API errors are handled and displayed appropriately

### Draft Management
- Drafts are saved to localStorage with timestamps
- Users can save multiple named drafts
- Drafts can be loaded or deleted as needed
- Auto-save runs every 30 seconds

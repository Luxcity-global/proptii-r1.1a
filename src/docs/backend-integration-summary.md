# Backend Integration Summary

This document summarizes the backend integration work completed for the referencing form application.

## Overview

We have implemented a comprehensive backend integration solution that connects the referencing form application to Azure services. The integration includes:

1. **API Service Layer**: A robust service layer for communicating with the backend API
2. **Azure Storage Integration**: Direct file uploads to Azure Blob Storage
3. **Draft Management**: Server-side draft saving and loading
4. **Environment Configuration**: Flexible configuration for different environments

## Components Implemented

### 1. API Service Layer

- Created a base API service (`src/services/api.ts`) that handles:
  - HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Authentication headers
  - Error handling
  - Response formatting

- Implemented a dedicated referencing service (`src/services/referencingService.ts`) with methods for:
  - Creating applications
  - Saving section data
  - Submitting applications
  - Managing documents
  - Managing drafts

### 2. Azure Storage Integration

- Implemented a storage service (`src/services/storageService.ts`) that provides:
  - Direct uploads to Azure Blob Storage
  - Progress tracking for uploads
  - File deletion
  - URL generation for stored files

- Enhanced the `DocumentUpload` component to:
  - Upload files directly to Azure Storage
  - Show upload progress
  - Handle upload errors
  - Display success/failure messages

### 3. Draft Management

- Updated the `DraftManager` component to:
  - Save drafts to the server via API
  - Load drafts from the server
  - Delete drafts from the server
  - Fall back to localStorage when API is not available

### 4. Environment Configuration

- Created configuration files for Azure services:
  - `src/config/azure.ts` for Azure service configuration
  - `.env.template` for environment variable templates

- Added utility functions for:
  - Checking if Azure is configured
  - Generating Azure Storage URLs
  - Managing SAS tokens

## Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - `src/docs/backend-integration.md`: Detailed guide for setting up backend integration
  - `src/docs/environment-setup.md`: Instructions for configuring environment variables

## API Endpoints

The integration uses the following API endpoints:

- **Applications**:
  - `POST /referencing/applications`: Create a new application
  - `GET /referencing/applications/{id}`: Get application data
  - `GET /referencing/applications/{id}/status`: Get application status

- **Sections**:
  - `PUT /referencing/applications/{id}/sections/{section}`: Save section data

- **Documents**:
  - `POST /referencing/applications/{id}/documents`: Upload a document
  - `GET /referencing/applications/{id}/documents`: Get all documents
  - `DELETE /referencing/applications/{id}/documents/{documentId}`: Delete a document

- **Drafts**:
  - `POST /referencing/applications/{id}/drafts`: Save a draft
  - `GET /referencing/applications/{id}/drafts`: Get all drafts
  - `GET /referencing/applications/{id}/drafts/{draftId}`: Load a draft
  - `DELETE /referencing/applications/{id}/drafts/{draftId}`: Delete a draft

## Next Steps

To complete the backend integration:

1. **API Implementation**:
   - Implement the backend API endpoints
   - Set up database models and controllers
   - Configure authentication and authorization

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Set up Azure SQL Database
   - Configure Azure Storage Account
   - Deploy the API to Azure App Service

3. **Testing**:
   - Test the integration end-to-end
   - Verify file uploads and downloads
   - Test form submission and validation

4. **Security**:
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Secure API endpoints
   - Configure CORS for Azure Storage

## Conclusion

The backend integration framework is now in place, providing a solid foundation for connecting the referencing form application to Azure services. The implementation follows best practices for error handling, type safety, and user experience.

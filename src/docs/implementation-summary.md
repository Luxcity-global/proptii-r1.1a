# ReferencingModal Implementation Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. Documentation and Planning
- Created a detailed component map of the existing application
- Documented current API simulation functions
- Created a comprehensive development plan with short, medium, and long-term goals

### 2. Component Refactoring
- Extracted MobileStepper into a separate component
- Extracted FormContent into a separate component
- Created a reusable FormField component for consistent styling
- Created a DocumentUpload component for handling file uploads

### 3. Data Persistence
- Created localStorage utility functions for saving and loading data
- Implemented a custom useLocalStorage hook for the referencing form
- Updated ReferencingContext to use the localStorage hook
- Added auto-save functionality
- Implemented draft saving and loading

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- Added confirmation dialog for unsaved changes
- Improved keyboard navigation with escape key support
- Added progress indicators for file uploads

## Next Steps

### 1. Form Validation
- Install and configure Yup or Zod for schema validation
- Create validation schemas for each form section
- Add real-time validation feedback
- Implement field-level error indicators

### 2. UI/UX Improvements
- Improve mobile experience
- Add tablet-specific layouts
- Implement success/error notifications
- Add skeleton loaders for async operations

### 3. Testing
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- Write tests for form validation
- Test form submission flow
- Test navigation between sections

### 4. Backend Integration
- Create a proper API client with TypeScript types
- Implement request/response interceptors
- Add retry logic and error handling
- Integrate with MSAL for secure API calls

## Implementation Notes

### Component Structure
The refactored ReferencingModal now follows a more modular structure:
```
ReferencingModal
├── ReferencingProvider (Context with localStorage)
├── MobileStepper (for mobile view)
├── ReferencingSidebar (for desktop view)
└── FormContent
    └── ReferencingForm
        ├── FormField (reusable field component)
        ├── DocumentUpload (reusable upload component)
        └── Section-specific forms
```

### Data Flow
1. User inputs data in form fields
2. Data is updated in ReferencingContext state
3. useLocalStorage hook automatically saves to localStorage
4. Auto-save runs every 30 seconds
5. User can manually save drafts with names

### Error Handling
- Form validation errors are displayed at the field level
- API errors are displayed at the form level
- Network errors trigger retry mechanisms

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Ensure VITE_REDIRECT_URI is correctly set for each environment
- Configure API endpoints for development, staging, and production

### Authentication
- Ensure MSAL is properly configured for each environment
- Test authentication flow in all environments

### Performance
- Implement code splitting for large form sections
- Optimize bundle size for production
- Add caching strategies for API responses

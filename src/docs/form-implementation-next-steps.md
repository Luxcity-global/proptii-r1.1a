# Form Implementation: Next Steps

## Completed Work

We have successfully implemented the core functionality of the referencing form:

1. **Form Validation**
   - Created Yup validation schemas for all form sections
   - Implemented conditional validation based on form state
   - Added real-time field validation

2. **Form Components**
   - Created reusable form components (FormField, DocumentUpload)
   - Implemented all form sections with proper validation
   - Added accessibility features to form components

3. **Draft Management**
   - Implemented a DraftManager component for saving and loading drafts
   - Added auto-save functionality
   - Created localStorage utilities for data persistence

4. **Navigation**
   - Implemented a multi-step form workflow with a stepper
   - Added back/next navigation with data preservation
   - Created a completion screen

## Next Steps

### 1. API Integration

- **Backend API**
  - Create API endpoints for form submission
  - Implement authentication and authorization
  - Add validation on the server side

- **Form Submission**
  - Update the form submission logic to send data to the API
  - Add loading states during submission
  - Implement error handling for API responses

### 2. Enhanced User Experience

- **Progress Persistence**
  - Implement server-side draft saving
  - Add auto-recovery of drafts
  - Create a drafts management page

- **Form Navigation**
  - Add a sidebar navigation for quick access to sections
  - Implement a progress indicator
  - Add keyboard shortcuts for navigation

- **Notifications**
  - Add toast notifications for successful actions
  - Implement error notifications
  - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### 3. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests**
  - Write tests for validation schemas
  - Test form components
  - Test draft management functionality

- **Integration Tests**
  - Test form submission flow
  - Test navigation between sections
  - Test draft saving and loading

- **Accessibility Testing**
  - Test with screen readers
  - Verify keyboard navigation
  - Ensure proper ARIA attributes

### 4. Performance Optimization

- **Code Splitting**
  - Lazy load form sections
  - Optimize bundle size
  - Implement code splitting for large dependencies

- **Rendering Optimization**
  - Memoize expensive computations
  - Optimize re-renders
  - Implement virtualization for large lists

### 5. Documentation

- **User Documentation**
  - Create a user guide
  - Add tooltips and help text
  - Implement a guided tour

- **Developer Documentation**
  - Document component API
  - Create usage examples
  - Add inline code comments
